ironruby-hpricot - a port of Hpricot for IronRuby
===============================================================================

Hpricot is a fast and flexible HTML parser, created by why the lucky stiff.

This is a port for IronRuby of Hpricot's parser created by generating C# code 
with Ragel off of a tweaked version of the original .rl grammar files, whereas 
String#fast_xs internals are based on Ola Bini's code ported to C#.
