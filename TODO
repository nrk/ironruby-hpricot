 * The current version of ironruby-hpricot is based off of hpricot 0.6.164, 
   but I'm already starting to work on aligning its code base to new features 
   from 0.6.207 (see _why's git repository http://github.com/why/hpricot/).

 * HpricotScanner.rl is still missing: I think I'll give an higher priority to 
   this task to be able to easily test the generation of HpricotScanner.cs by 
   passing -F1 and -G1 flags to Ragel, just to see which one is the best 
   speed and memory wise.

 * README needs to be populated with notes and building instructions. The code 
   needs the right dose of comments.

 * Add tests
