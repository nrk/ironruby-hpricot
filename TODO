 * The current version of ironruby-hpricot is based off of hpricot 0.6.164, 
   but I'm already starting to work on aligning its code base to new features 
   from 0.6.207 (see _why's git repository http://github.com/why/hpricot/).

 * If @buffer_size is defined, its value should be used as the buffer size for 
   IO#read operations overriding the default buffer size.

 * HpricotScanner.rl is still missing

 * README needs to be populated with notes and building instructions. The code 
   needs the right dose of comments.

 * Add tests
